I created a repository on Git Hub called python-challenge. Cloned it and pulled it to my computer. Using terminal created needed folders and files for PyBank and PyPoll.  
My python-challenge repository contans the main python script file, csv file, and the outcome file for each folder. Here I am providing the outcome results for PyBank and PyPoll scripts.
